Lets learn one way of visualizing data. If we would like to make a scatter plot of data of players careers strike outs versus their career Homeruns, only for those who have hit 400 or more Homeruns this is what we would do.

First we need to install and library some packages:

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE} 
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Now we may begin working with our R script:

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,sum(HR) as career_HR,sum(SO) as career_SO from Batting
group by playerID
having sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR),size=3,color="red")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts VS Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
