<p>Lets learn one way of visualizing data. If we would like to make a scatter plot of data of players careers strike outs versus their career Homeruns, only for those who have hit 400 or more Homeruns this is what we would do.</p>
<p>First we need to install and library some packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Now we may begin working with our R script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;select playerID,sum(HR) as career_HR,sum(SO) as career_SO from Batting
group by playerID
having sum(HR)&gt;=400&quot;

result&lt;-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR),size=3,color=&quot;red&quot;)+
  ggtitle(&quot;Career Strikeouts VS Homeruns for Great Hitters&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Career Strikeouts&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Career Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
